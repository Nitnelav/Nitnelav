### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an acoustic & vibrations engineer and a software developer, currently working as a research engineer at UniversitÃ© Gustave Eiffel with the wonderful people in [UMRAE](https://www.umrae.fr/) and [SPLOTT](https://splott.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/) labs.

I am currently working on :

- Cool environmental acoustic monitoring station based on the Raspberry Pi
- Gorgeous synthetic population and traffic models with [EQASim](https://eqasim.org/) and [MATSim](https://www.matsim.org/)
- Epic noise maps with [NoiseModelling](https://noise-planet.org/noisemodelling.html)  
- Sweet acoustic stuff such as [AcousticNode](https://github.com/Nitnelav/AcousticNode)

And plenty more ...
